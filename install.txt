WebPA 2.0.0.10
==============

Installation Guide
------------------

*  Edit the includes/inc_global.php file in the includes directory to configure the application; in particular:
     - APP__WWW: URL to the instance of WebPA (without a closing "/");
     - DOC__ROOT: directory path to the WebPA files (with a closing "/" or "\\");
     - database settings:
        - APP__DB_HOST: host name
        - APP__DB_USERNAME: username
        - APP__DB_PASSWORD: password
        - APP__DB_DATABASE: database name
        - APP__DB_TABLE_PREFIX: table prefix (default is "pa2_" which means that the new version can share the same database as the old version if required)
     - configure the LDAP settings if you wish to authenticate via LDAP.
     
*  Run the following scripts to initialise the database (edit the files to change the names and password as reqired):
     - install/webpa2_database.sql: create the database schema and user account;
     - install/webpa2_tables.sql: create the database tables;
     - install/webpa2_administrator.sql: create an administrator account and sample module.
     
*  Login to WebPA:
		 - navigate to root of WebPA application;
		 - enter a username of "admin" and a password of "admin"
		 - change the password to something more secure after logging in
		 
*  Delete the "install" folder when you're finished.

## Database Migrations

Webpa uses the [Phinx](https://phinx.org/) migrations tool to update the database scheme.  After installing or updating the application you should do the following to make sure that the database schema is up to date:

1. rename `phinx.yml.defaults` to `phinx.yml`
2. edit `phinx.yml` to set the database details for a database user with rights to alter the database.
3. If [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is not already installed on the server run `curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php` (look at the composer website for instructions on installing composer on different machines if this doesn't work for you). 
4. Run `php composer.phar install` to install Phinx.
5. Run `vendor/bin/phinx migrate` to update the database.
